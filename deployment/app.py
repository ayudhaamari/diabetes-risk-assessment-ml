        Diabetes is a growing public health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide. **Early detection and effective intervention are critical** to managing this condition and reducing associated health risks. The CDC provides a dataset that includes health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, age, physical activity, and other factors that could be linked to diabetes. By understanding these factors and creating predictive models, public health agencies and individuals can take proactive steps toward better management and prevention of diabetes. **As a data scientist from hospital "XYZ"**, you are tasked to develop a machine learning model that can predict an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on survey information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). 
        
        The prevalence of diabetes has significantly increased, creating a public health burden. 
        The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict an individual's risk of 
        developing diabetes with 80% recall within six months, enabling better early intervention strategies.

        This project focuses on creating a classification model to predict diabetes by evaluating
