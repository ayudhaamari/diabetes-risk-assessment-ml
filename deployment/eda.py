Conversely, features showing **weak or negligible correlations** may not be as relevant for `diabetes risk assessment`. **Moderately correlated variables** suggest they could also contribute meaningfully to `predictive models`. This correlation analysis is **valuable for feature selection** in `predictive modeling`, as it helps identify the **most informative variables** without the need for `encoding`, thanks to the `phik correlation's` ability to handle both `numerical` and `categorical data`. By focusing on **strongly correlated features**, we can potentially **enhance the accuracy and efficiency** of `diabetes risk prediction models`.")
